# Fraud Detection with Transformer-Enhanced VAE

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an innovative approach to financial fraud detection by combining **Transformer architectures** with **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** for enhanced anomaly detection in transaction data.

## 🚀 Key Innovation

**Individual Transaction Processing**: Unlike traditional sequence-based approaches, this method uses transformers to enhance features within individual transactions, creating richer representations for the VAE to learn from.

## 📊 Results Achieved

| Model | Dataset | ROC AUC | Improvement |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Baseline VAE | PaySim | 0.5989 | - |
| **Transformer + VAE** | PaySim | **0.7921** | **+32.3%** |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Transformer Networks, Variational Autoencoders
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Evaluation**: ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix Analysis
